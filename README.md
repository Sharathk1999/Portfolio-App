# The Portfolio App

This project aims to recreate a portfolio page based on a provided Figma design. The app will use Flutter and the flutter_screen_utils package to ensure responsive fonts and spacing. The design's colors and aesthetics will be closely followed, and the app will include features like a scrollable portfolio, a non-functional Filter button, static card data, and a matching bottom navigation bar.

#### Key Features:

🚀Responsive Design: Utilizes flutter_screen_utils for adaptive fonts and spacing across different screen sizes.

🚀Design Adherence: Closely follows the provided Figma design for colors, layout, and overall appearance.

🚀Scrollable Portfolio: Allows users to scroll through the portfolio content.

🚀Static Card Data: Uses pre-defined data for the portfolio cards.

🚀Bottom Navigation Bar: Matches the Figma design's bottom navigation bar, with interactive icons and an indicator.

🚀Search Functionality: Filters cards based on their title text when the user types in the search bar.
